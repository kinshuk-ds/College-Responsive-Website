# College-Responsive-Website

A responsive college website is a website that has been designed to adapt to different screen sizes and devices, such as desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. This means that the layout, images and text on the website will automatically adjust to fit the screen size and resolution of the device being used to view the website. This allows for a consistent and optimal user experience, regardless of the device being used to access the website. 

A responsive website is typically built using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and often uses CSS media queries to determine the screen size and apply different styles accordingly. I have used Media queries to make this website responsive. This project is made with the help of HTML and CSS and contains details about amity university. This website also contains contact as well as course details and if the person has any query he/she can post it aswell.
